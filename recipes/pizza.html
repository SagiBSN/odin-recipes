    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pizza mimosa is a variety of Italian pizza bianca or white pizza that is topped with cream, <br>
        cooked ham, corn, and mozzarella cheese. Commonly referred to as panna prosciutto e mais or <br>
        pizza con prosciutto e mais, the pizza is usually drizzled with olive oil and garnished with fresh basil leaves. <br>
        There is also a vegetarian and gluten-free version of pizza mimosa that calls for topping the pizza with scamorza  <br>
        cheese or mozzarella, arugula, and olive oil. Pizza mimosa is occasionally prepared with a layer of tomato sauce underneath <br>
        the creamy and cheesy toppings.
